The github pages for app, blog, and help content.

## Getting Started

Ensure `bundler` is updated by issuing the following command.

```bash
gem update bundler
```

Install the `github-pages` gem by issuing the following command.

```bash
gem install github-pages
```

## Handy Commands

From the 'blog/' or 'help/' folders, issue the following command to preview your latest edits. Your site will be hosted on port `4000`.

```bash
jekyll serve
```

You can then access your preview sites via the following urls.

* [Localhost Blog](http://localhost:4000/pages/blog/) &mdash; http://localhost:4000/pages/blog/
* [Localhost Help](http://localhost:4000/pages/help/) &mdash; http://localhost:4000/pages/help/
