I have a specific idea for a social media site in mind, but I decided to build a generic site first. Everything is being built as if it were production-ready code, minus dynamic data, security, and performance. Those are also very real goals of mine, but [I wanted to get the shell fleshed out](https://beebee.social/buzz) first.

As for performance, I’m planning to build everything using a microservice architecture that can easily scale out. Security will include the concept of zero-trust networks, which I’m learning as I go. And the data flow will likely involve a message queue, feeding multiple copies of the system-of-record.

At the moment, I’m tweaking my existing UI to be responsive. About half my friends who’ve kicked the tires on the new site have tried to do so from their phones. So, I can’t avoid it any longer.
