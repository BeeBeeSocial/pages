<p>I’ve been using Facebook’s <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> framework to build BeeBee.social, starting from a clean <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> project. There were some bumps along the road, but in general it’s been a great experience. Everything just works. That is, until I created an optimized build and hosted it on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>Only the generated index.html and scripts are deployed, so when you try to deep link into the application, you’re rewarded with the GitHub Pages 404 error page.</p>

<p>There’s really no server configuration on GitHub Pages, but the redirect to a custom 404 is a great hook to add some javascript that works the deep link magic.</p>

<p>I won’t got into the details here. <a href="http://www.backalleycoder.com/2016/05/13/sghpa-the-single-page-app-hack-for-github-pages/">Daniel’s post</a> has all the info you need to recreate this clever hack.</p>
